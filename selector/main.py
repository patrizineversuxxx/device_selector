    Orchestrates the device selection process.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Opens user and affected device data from JSON files.
    2. Creates departments from the user and device data.
    3. Saves the department records in a preparation XLSX table.
    4. Filters job titles, deletes records from a previous table, and saves the result in another XLSX file.
    5. Randomly selects devices based on user conditions.
    6. Saves the result of the device selection in an XLSX table.

    Orchestrates the device selection process.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Opens user and affected device data from JSON files.
    2. Creates departments from the user and device data.
    3. Saves the department records in a preparation XLSX table.
    4. Filters job titles, deletes records from a previous table, and saves the result in another XLSX file.
    5. Randomly selects devices based on user conditions.
    6. Saves the result of the device selection in an XLSX table.

        configuration (Config): A configuration object containing file paths and selection conditions.
